Welcome
=====================================

:mod:`scikits.bvp_solver` is a python package for solving two point boundary value problems which is based on a modified version of the `BVP_SOLVER <http://cs.stmarys.ca/~muir/BVP_SOLVER_Webpage.shtml>`_ Fortran package. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions about this tutorial, the examples or bvp_solver itself, please e-mail them to the mailing list or to me at jsalvati@u.washington.edu.

Installing and learning to use :mod:`scikits.bvp_solver`
-----------------------------------------
The easiest way to learn how to install and use :mod:`scikits.bvp_solver` is to read the :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`. It is also helpful to look at the :doc:`examples <examples/examples>`, and to read about the :doc:`template generator <core.get_template>`, which will generate a code skeleton for a boundary value problem which can then be filled in. Using the template generator reduces the busywork of solving a boundary value problem.
